CMSI 4071 Fall 2025
=======================================

COMPONENT BREAKDOWN:
Very nice introduction, and the parts of your application are clear on the
CSCI breakdown section.

FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
Strengths:
   Subsystem breakdown is clear: Game Manager, Player, Inventory Manager,
      Narrative & Dialogue, Puzzle, and Art/UI CSCs are well-defined.
   Detailed gameplay features: Includes movement, item collection,
      branching dialogue, puzzle mechanics, and UI scaling.
   Persistence and state management: Requirements for saving/loading
      progress and inventory persistence are explicitly stated.

Gaps / Suggestions:
   Error handling: No explicit requirements for handling invalid inputs,
      corrupted save files, or failed asset loads.
   Accessibility: Missing requirements for color-blind modes, font scaling,
      or screen reader support.
   Audio system: No functional requirements for sound effects or music
      integration.
   Multiplayer or extensibility: Assumes single-player only; no mention of
      future scalability or mod support.
   Security: No mention of secure handling of user data or preventing
      tampering with save files.

PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS:
Strengths:
   Quantifiable metrics provided:
      Game initialization: =10 seconds.
      Frame rate: =30 FPS.
      Scene transitions: =5 seconds.
      Inventory/UI updates: =1 second.
      Save/load: =3–5 seconds.
   Memory usage constraint: =1 GB RAM during gameplay.

Gaps / Suggestions:
   Stress testing: No requirements for performance under large inventories
      or complex puzzles.
   Hardware variability: Metrics assume “standard laptop” but do not specify
      behavior on lower-end systems.
   Network considerations: No mention of online features or latency handling
      (if future updates include cloud saves).
   Error recovery performance: Missing time limits for recovering from
      crashes or failed loads.

ENVIRONMENT REQUIREMENTS:
Strengths:
   Hardware specs: Minimum and development machine requirements are clearly
      listed (CPU, RAM, GPU, display).
   Software stack: Unity 2D, C#, GitHub, BOX, art tools, and IDEs are
      specified.
   Cross-platform support: Windows and macOS are included.

Gaps / Suggestions:
   Deployment details: No mention of packaging, installer requirements, or
      distribution platform (e.g., Steam, itch.io).
   Testing environment: No requirements for automated testing or QA tools.
   Security environment: No mention of encryption for save files or version
      control security.
   Future scalability: No guidance for supporting Linux or mobile platforms.

   Subtotal                            8/8
   Preliminary Schedule                2/2   Initial schedule is OK, but
                                             consider a PERT or Gantt chart
   ------------------------------------------------------
   Total Percentage:   10/10 = 100% which is an A-plus


Overall Assessment
Functional requirements: Strong coverage of core gameplay and UI, but missing
   accessibility, error handling, audio, and security details.
Performance requirements: Well-defined and measurable, but lacks stress/load
   testing and recovery metrics.
Environmental requirements: Adequate for development and execution, but
   missing deployment, testing, and security considerations.

Make sure you incorporate all the suggestions into the document by the end
of the semester for full credit on this deliverable.

Nice job!

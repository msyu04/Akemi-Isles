=========================

Proposal Document [3 points]:
-----------------------------
Well done on the proposal document!  I like the idea a lot ~ using mythology
tales is a grand idea.  I'm a fan of problem solving games, too.  I'll look
forward to playing this when it is completed.

I like the way you have described the parts and have an example that gives
the reader an idea of what to expect.  The core features sound good and will
provide you with enough to give you a good semester's worth of work.

Nice justification and wrap-up sections, too!

Proposal Presentation [2 points]:
---------------------------------
Your presentation was very good, met all the requirements as listed, and
provided enough detail so the audience saw interested without having so
much text that they couldn't read it all before the next slide appeared.
I enjoyed the presentation and you answered questions well.  Make sure you
talk to the audience, not the slides, and feel free to spread out to the
other side of the room so you're not all bunched up together [I know that
there is 'safety in numbers'.... :D]

I really liked the backgrounds on the slides, too!  The graphics were one
of the high points for me.  The text on the justification slide was a bit
hard to read because of the text color blending into the background, but
it worked out in the room, I think...

Overall, very good!

Summary:
--------
Nice job overall!  Keep up the good work.

5 out of 5 which is an A-plus on this deliverable.
